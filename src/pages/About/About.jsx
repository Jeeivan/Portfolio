      <h2>Hi!</h2>
      <p>As a former senior Physiotherapist, I embarked on a transformative journey driven by my passion for technology and the dynamic nature of the industry, leading me to embrace a new career path as a software engineer. Due to my passion for technology and the industry’s constant evolution, I was strongly drawn to this field and made the decision to pursue a complete career change towards becoming a software engineer. I firmly believe that the communication, leadership, and adaptive skills I gained through my role as a physiotherapist will seamlessly translate into a tech environment.<br />Always being eager to learn and relishing challenges that involve problem-solving, I knew that enrolling in General Assembly’s 3-month software engineering immersive program would be the perfect fit for me to refine my skills. I am now eager to expand upon the skills I have acquired in order to secure a full-stack role where I can leverage my abilities to their maximum potential.</p>
